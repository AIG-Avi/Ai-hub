# Military-Grade Security for AI Hub Project

## 1. Code Security
- All user inputs and outputs are sanitized using server-side and client-side validation.
- Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are set in Flask (see app.py).
- HTTPS enforced everywhere with HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).
- All forms and requests are validated on both client and server side.
- Unused/insecure libraries are removed; only trusted dependencies are used.

## 2. Authentication & Access Control
- Passwords are hashed using Argon2 (recommended) or bcrypt.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforced for admin and sensitive actions.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implemented for user/admin separation.
- Admin pages require additional verification (MFA, IP allowlist).
- API keys and secrets are stored in .env and never hardcoded.

## 3. Dependency & Server Hardening
- Automatic dependency scanning enabled (Dependabot, pip-audit).
- Only required services and ports are open; strict firewall rules applied.
- Security headers set: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection.

## 4. Data Security
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256.
- All traffic is encrypted in transit with TLS 1.3.
- Database records use hashed IDs and encryption for sensitive fields.
- APIs are rate-limited and protected against DDoS.

## 5. Monitoring & Logging
- Centralized logging with alerting for suspicious activity (e.g., ELK stack).
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS) integrated.
- Security audit scripts scan for vulnerabilities regularly.

## 6. Frontend Security Best Practices
- All user-generated content is sanitized before rendering.
- Right-click, console logs, and error exposure are disabled in production.
- Strict CORS rules enforced.

## 7. Development Workflow Security
- Code reviews required for all commits.
- Git hooks scan for secrets before commit.
- Signed commits and branch protection enabled.
- Automated penetration testing in CI/CD pipeline.

## 8. Computer & Local Security
- Disable unnecessary ports/services on local machine.
- Full-disk encryption (BitLocker/VeraCrypt) recommended.
- Strong firewall and antivirus (Defender + Malwarebytes) enforced.
- Project runs in isolated containers (Docker/VM).
- Regular encrypted cloud backups.

## Future Improvements
- Add automated security patching for all dependencies.
- Integrate advanced anomaly detection for user behavior.
- Regular third-party penetration testing.
- Continuous security training for developers.
